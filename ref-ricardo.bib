abstract = {Understanding pedestrian behaviour and controlling interactions with pedestrians is of critical importance for autonomous vehicles, but remains a complex and challenging problem. This study infers pedestrian intent during possible road-crossing interactions, to assist autonomous vehicle decisions to yield or not yield when approaching them, and tests a simple heuristic model of intent on pedestrian-vehicle trajectory data for the first time. It relies on a heuristic approach based on the observed positions of the agents over time. The method can predict pedestrian crossing intent, crossing or stopping, with 96% accuracy by the time the pedestrian reaches the curbside, on the standard Daimler pedestrian dataset. This result is important in demarcating scenarios which have a clear winner and can be predicted easily with the simple heuristic, from those which may require more complex game-theoretic models to predict and control.},

abstract = {Avoiding vehicle-to-pedestrian crashes is a critical requirement for nowadays advanced driver assistant systems (ADAS) and future self-driving vehicles. Accordingly, detecting pedestrians from raw sensor data has a history of more than 15 years of research, with vision playing a central role. During the last years, deep learning has boosted the accuracy of image-based pedestrian detectors. However, detection is just the first step towards answering the core question, namely is the vehicle going to crash with a pedestrian provided preventive actions are not taken? Therefore, knowing as soon as possible if a detected pedestrian has the intention of crossing the road ahead of the vehicle is essential for performing safe and comfortable maneuvers that prevent a crash. However, compared to pedestrian detection, there is relatively little literature on detecting pedestrian intentions. This paper aims to contribute along this line by presenting a new vision-based approach which analyzes the pose of a pedestrian along several frames to determine if he or she is going to enter the road or not. We present experiments showing 750 ms of anticipation for pedestrians crossing the road, which at a typical urban driving speed of 50 km/h can provide 15 additional meters (compared to a pure pedestrian detector) for vehicle automatic reactions or to warn the driver. Moreover, in contrast with state-of-the-art methods, our approach is monocular, neither requiring stereo nor optical flow information.},

Early this year, a benchmark comprising JAAD and PIE datasets have been released. In the benchmark, several state-of-the-art methods have been ranked. However, most of the ranked temporal models rely on recurrent architectures. In our case, we propose, as far as we are concerned, the first self-attention alternative, based on transformer architecture, which has had enormous success in natural language processing (NLP) and recently in computer vision. Our architecture is composed of various branches which fuse video and kinematic data. The video branch is based on two possible architectures: RubiksNet and TimeSformer. The kinematic branch is based on different configurations of transformer encoder. Several experiments have been performed mainly focusing on pre-processing input data, highlighting problems with two kinematic data sources: pose keypoints and ego-vehicle speed. Our proposed model results are comparable to PCPA, the best performing model in the benchmark reaching an F1 Score of nearly 0.78 against 0.77. Furthermore, by using only bounding box coordinates and image data, our model surpasses PCPA by a larger margin (F1 = 0.75 vs. F1 = 0.72). Our model has proven to be a valid alternative to recurrent architectures, providing advantages such as parallelization and whole sequence processing, learning relationships between samples not possible with recurrent architectures.},

Predicting the walking direction of a pedestrian could help to avoid an eventual accident. Existing studies can not handle pose and orientation transformations of the input object contrary to our proposed method. This paper describes a novel approach to determine the pedestrian orientation using Capsule Networks (CapsNet) based scheme. CapsNet are a new deep learning architecture that overcome some limitations of the existing studies, they are group of neurons invariant to rotation and affine transformations, which represent a specific interest to this work. Capsule Networks predicts the walking directions of pedestrians to prevent such mortal accidents, using four main walking directions (front, back, left and right).For this purpose, a new pedestrians dataset gathered from the most popular cities in Morocco is collected to be studied and used as a proof of the proposed approach. To enhance this proposed approach, we evaluated it using Daimler dataset and compared it to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures.Experimental results reveal that the performance of the proposed approach reaches an accuracy of 97.60% on daimler dataset and 73.64% on our Moroccan collected dataset.},

To achieve this task the algorithm does pose estimation, feature matching, and facial detection to acquire the position of the pedestrians and distinguish if they notice the vehicle. The algorithm calculates the 3D coordinates of a given pedestrian using the vehicle as a reference, tracking the movement of the pedestrian during all the process, thus providing meta-information of this interaction, which allows to process this information at higher levels: e.g. if the pedestrians feels conformable to cross, or if he performs any other maneuver moving away from the trajectory. The proposed algorithm was tested in campus scenarios where pedestrians and vehicle shared the environment, and the results proved the viability, providing a tool, useful for researchers which allows to process high amounts of information without the need of supervision.},

Standard approaches rely on 2D or 3D convolutions to process such context, resulting in expensive operations with millions of parameters.

Naively extending such developments to a 3D setting is a difficult, intractable goal. To this end, we introduce RubiksNet, a new efficient architecture for video action recognition which is based on a proposed learnable 3D spatiotemporal shift operation instead. We analyze the suitability of our new primitive for video action recognition and explore several novel variations of our approach to enable stronger representational flexibility while maintaining an efficient design. We benchmark our approach on several standard video recognition datasets, and observe that our method achieves comparable or better accuracy than prior work on efficient video action recognition at a fraction of the performance cost, with 2.9–5.9× fewer parameters and 2.1–3.7× fewer FLOPs. We also perform a series of controlled ablation studies to verify our significant boost in the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff curve is rooted in the core contributions of our RubiksNet architecture.},

@article{Bertasius2021,
abstract = {We present a convolution-free approach to video classification built exclusively on self-attention over space and time. Our method, named "TimeSformer," adapts the standard Transformer architecture to video by enabling spatiotemporal feature learning directly from a sequence of frame-level patches. Our experimental study compares different self-attention schemes and suggests that "divided attention," where temporal attention and spatial attention are separately applied within each block, leads to the best video classification accuracy among the design choices considered. Despite the radically new design, TimeSformer achieves state-of-the-art results on several action recognition benchmarks, including the best reported accuracy on Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600. Finally, compared to 3D convolutional networks, our model is faster to train, it can achieve dramatically higher test efficiency (at a small drop in accuracy), and it can also be applied to much longer video clips (over one minute long). Code and models are available at: https://github.com/facebookresearch/TimeSformer.},

   abstract = {Attention has arguably become one of the most important concepts in the deep learning field. It is inspired by the biological systems of humans that tend to focus on the distinctive parts when processing large amounts of information. With the development of deep neural networks, attention mechanism has been widely used in diverse application domains. This paper aims to give an overview of the state-of-the-art attention models proposed in recent years. Toward a better general understanding of attention mechanisms, we define a unified model that is suitable for most attention structures. Each step of the attention mechanism implemented in the model is described in detail. Furthermore, we classify existing attention models according to four criteria: the softness of attention, forms of input feature, input representation, and output representation. Besides, we summarize network architectures used in conjunction with the attention mechanism and describe some typical applications of attention mechanism. Finally, we discuss the interpretability that attention brings to deep learning and present its potential future trends.},

abstract = {Pedestrian behavior anticipation is a key challenge in the design of assistive and autonomous driving systems suitable for urban environments. An intelligent system should be able to understand the intentions or underlying motives of pedestrians and to predict their forthcoming actions. To date, only a few public datasets were proposed for the purpose of studying pedestrian behavior prediction in the context of intelligent driving. To this end, we propose a novel large-scale dataset designed for pedestrian intention estimation (PIE). We conducted a large-scale human experiment to establish human reference data for pedestrian intention in traffic scenes. We propose models for estimating pedestrian crossing intention and predicting their future trajectory. Our intention estimation model achieves 79% accuracy and our trajectory prediction algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art by 26% on the proposed dataset. We further show that combining pedestrian intention with observed motion improves trajectory prediction. The dataset and models are available at http://data.nvision2.eecs.yorku.ca/PIE-dataset/.},

abstract = {In the context of future urban automated driving many important problems remain unsolved. A critical one is the analysis and prediction of pedestrian movements around urban roads. Especially the analysis of non-critical situations has not received much attention in the past. This paper focuses on analyzing and predicting movements of pedestrians approaching crosswalks, a very crucial pedestrian-vehicle interaction in urban scenarios. In our previous work, we analyzed the performance of a data-driven Support Vector Machine-based architecture, and the relevance of specific features to infer pedestrian crossing intentions. In this paper, we will use our previous results as baseline to compare against an architecture based on neural networks for time-series classification. In particular we analyze the effectiveness of dense and Long- Short-Term-Memory networks. Furthermore, we will be looking into enhancing our feature vectors by adding LiDAR based images to the classification process. Additionally the evaluation provides an estimate for the temporal prediction horizon. The approaches presented are validated with real world trajectories recorded in Germany. Our results show an average accuracy improvement of 1020% with respect to our previous Support Vector Machine-based approach.},

In recent decades, numerous papers have extensively addressed the problem of VRU path prediction, which has a wide range of applications such as video surveillance and autonomous driving. The behavioral complexity of VRUs has forced researchers to employ various techniques in order to develop more comprehensive models that potentially respond better to VRUs movement patterns. This indeed has led to development of a large variety of models and approaches in the literature. The aim of this paper is to a) provide a comprehensive review of developed path prediction methods, b) individuate and classify the proposed methods from multiple viewpoints, and c) present a framework for better understanding of various aspects in VRUs path prediction problems.},
